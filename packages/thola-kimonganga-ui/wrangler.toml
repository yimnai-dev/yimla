# Automatically place your workloads in an optimal location to minimize latency.
# If you are running back-end logic in a Pages Function, running it closer to your back-end infrastructure
# rather than the end user may result in better performance.

# Variable bindings. These are arbitrary, plaintext strings (similar to environment variables)
# Docs:

# Bind a Durable Object. Durable objects are a scale-to-zero compute primitive based on the actor model.
# Durable Objects can live for as long as needed. Use these when you need a long-running "server", such as in realtime apps.

# binding = "MY_KV_NAMESPACE"
# id = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"

# Bind a Queue producer. Use this binding to schedule an arbitrary task that may be processed later by a Queue consumer.
# Docs: https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/functions/bindings/#queue-producers
# [[queues.producers]]
# binding = "MY_QUEUE"
# queue = "my-queue"

# Bind an R2 Bucket. Use R2 to store arbitrarily large blobs of data, such as files.
# Docs: https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/functions/bindings/#r2-buckets
# [[r2_buckets]]
# binding = "MY_BUCKET"

# Bind another Worker service. Use this binding to call another Worker without network overhead.

# [[services]]
# binding = "MY_SERVICE"
# service = "my-service"

# To use different bindings for preview and production environments, follow the examples below.
# When using environment-specific overrides for bindings, ALL bindings must be specified on a per-environment basis.
